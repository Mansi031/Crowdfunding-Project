ðŸ“Š Crowdfunding Projects â€“ SQL Data Analysis
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive crowdfunding dataset using SQL to uncover patterns, success factors, and trends influencing project outcomes. It focuses on evaluating project performance based on funding goals, categories, geographical distribution, timelines, and engagement metrics such as the number of backers.

The dataset includes details like project creation and launch dates, funding goals, pledged amounts, categories, locations, and outcomes (e.g., successful, failed). SQL queries are used to transform raw UNIX timestamps into human-readable dates, calculate funding conversions, and generate aggregated insights.

ðŸ›  Key SQL Analysis Components
Date Conversions â€“ Transforming created_at, launched_at, deadline, and state_changed_at UNIX timestamps into standard date formats for analysis.

Funding Goals â€“ Extracting and calculating funding goals in USD for comparison and visualization.

Outcome Analysis â€“ Counting total projects grouped by their state (e.g., successful, failed, canceled).
